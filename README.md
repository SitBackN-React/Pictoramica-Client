## Planning/Coding Experience - Team Project
As a team, we first discussed what kind of application we wanted to build next. After working together on Oasis Spaces, we knew that we wanted to further our skills in React as well as add more features. We wanted to create an app that would give users a platform to share their experiences about a specific topic, provide images for their blog or simply share to the world, and have the option to sell items. For example, if a user wanted to create refashion DIY sewing pieces, s/he is able to blog about their sewing experiences, post pictures of their projects, as well as have the option to sell their completed pieces.

After deciding the purpose of our new application, we created a spreadsheet containing all of the features we needed to include to meet MVP. Then, we divided up the features in order to set up the backend models and then the frontend components. We met as a team weekly to discuss our successes, processes, ideas, problem areas, and what we would work on for the following week. Although we began with working on separate features, we intertwined our work as we enhanced each feature.
